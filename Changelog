Changelog for Carson and Carrie: (Jiachen Liu and Kaixuan Wang, Team 60)

March 29, 2018
-	Carson: Research on Fast Fourier Transform
-	Carrie: Research on Fast Fourier Transform
March 30, 2018
-	Carson: Reimplementation of wave drawing to account for refresh rate of monitor
-	Carrie: Tried different Fast Fourier Transform algorithm 
March 31, 2018
-	Carson: hanged wave drawing to sample and store into array then print from array
-	Carrie: Implemented Fast Fourier Transform c algorithm and tested it
April 1, 2018
-	Carson: Added refresh rate wait
-	Carrie: Linked algorithm to assembly project, it takes double array input and returns a double array of amplitude (frequency domain)

Aprril 5, 2018
-	Carson: working on normalizing audio wave & frequency using switches
-	Carrie: Fast fourier transform bugfixing(problem with data size)

Aprril 6, 2018
-	Carson: wrote code for displaying lines on vga, which can be used for displaying freq
-	Carrie: linked c file to assembly, working on connect it to fifo 

Aprril 7, 2018
-	Carson: wrote code for keyboard interrupt (reads user input and decide which to show wave/frequency)
-	Carrie: working on extracting data from fifo and return data array to proper address

Aprril 8, 2018
-	Carson: linked all parts together
-	Carrie: fixing displaying frequency 
Aprril 9, 2018
-	Carson: final editing
-	Carrie: final editing
